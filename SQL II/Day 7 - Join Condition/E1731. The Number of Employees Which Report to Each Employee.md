# E1731. The Number of Employees Which Report to Each Employee

## Description

Table: `Employees`

```
+-------------+----------+
| Column Name | Type     |
+-------------+----------+
| employee_id | int      |
| name        | varchar  |
| reports_to  | int      |
| age         | int      |
+-------------+----------+
employee_id is the primary key for this table.
This table contains information about the employees and the id of the manager they report to. Some employees do not report to anyone (reports_to is null). 
```

 

For this problem, we will consider a **manager** an employee who has at least 1 other employee reporting to them.

Write an SQL query to report the ids and the names of all **managers**, the number of employees who report **directly** to them, and the average age of the reports rounded to the nearest integer.

Return the result table ordered by `employee_id`.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 
Employees table:
+-------------+---------+------------+-----+
| employee_id | name    | reports_to | age |
+-------------+---------+------------+-----+
| 9           | Hercy   | null       | 43  |
| 6           | Alice   | 9          | 41  |
| 4           | Bob     | 9          | 36  |
| 2           | Winston | null       | 37  |
+-------------+---------+------------+-----+
Output: 
+-------------+-------+---------------+-------------+
| employee_id | name  | reports_count | average_age |
+-------------+-------+---------------+-------------+
| 9           | Hercy | 2             | 39          |
+-------------+-------+---------------+-------------+
Explanation: Hercy has 2 people report directly to him, Alice and Bob. Their average age is (41+36)/2 = 38.5, which is 39 after rounding it to the nearest integer.
```



## Solution

- We can first use subquery to count the `reports_to` and `ROUND(AVG)`and match the `employee_id` with the `reports_to` in the subquery

```sql
SELECT e.employee_id, name, q.reports_count, q.average_age
FROM employees e
JOIN (
    SELECT reports_to, COUNT(reports_to) AS reports_count, ROUND(AVG(age),0) AS average_age
    FROM employees
    WHERE reports_to IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY reports_to) q
ON e.employee_id = q.reports_to
ORDER BY e.employee_id;
```

```sql
SELECT e2.employee_id, e2.name, COUNT(e2.employee_id) AS 'reports_count',
    ROUND(AVG(e1.age),0) AS 'average_age'
FROM Employees e1 
LEFT JOIN Employees e2 
ON e1.reports_to = e2.employee_id
WHERE e1.reports_to IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY e2.employee_id
ORDER BY e2.employee_id
```
